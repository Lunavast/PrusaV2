The Lunaast Prusa V2 is a full linear bearing version of the original Lunavast Prusa 3D printer based on the Prusa Mendel.

The Lunavast Prusa V2 can be purchased as a complete kit with everything you need from our web store (a choice of with or without RP parts):

Qty required for each RP part can be found in the 'LunavastPrusaV2-RP-Parts-BOM' PDF file.

Assembly Instructions (which also contains the non-RP parts BOM) can be found in the downloads section:

Important notes if you are planning to build your own Lunavast Prusa V2:
- Most dimensions of holes and bearing holders are larger than actual. We use skeinforge with a slightly increased flow rate to give stronger parts (we enter a filament diameter value of 5-6% less than actual, or you can tweak packing density ratio as well to get the same result). We suggest printing out one of the parts, for example the 'x-end-motor' or one of the bottom bearing holders to check for fit (especially if you use a different slicing software, eg. Slic3r which has some hole compensation code in more recent versions which may give different results). Alternatively, the affected models may be modified - SketchUp .skp design files can be found in the 'SKP-files' folder.
